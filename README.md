# An investigation into the Fisher's Iris Data Set

## BY: Trish OGrady

### Introduction:

In 1936, Ronald Fisher, a statistician and biologist developed a linear function to differentiate Iris species based on the morphology of their flowers. The Fisherâ€™s Iris data set contains 50 samples of the 3 Iris species. They are Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris versicolor. The dataset contains 4 features - the widths and lengths of petals and sepals. Its reguraly used to test machine learning alogoritms.[1]

### Dataset

The Iris dataset is downloaded as a csv format.

### Explanation of code

*Import Pandas Library*

* The Pandas python toolkit which is an open source, is used for data analysis. It makes working with CSV files simplier and more effective as it can read and write data from different formats, i.e CSV (Common Seperated Values)[2] The dataframe object is also useful for subsetting which will be demonstated in this project.
* print(file_read) clarifies that file-read is the object name that contains the csv file
