Fisher's Iris Data Set

Introduction:

In 1936, Ronald Fisher, a statistician and biologist developed a linear function to differentiate Iris species based on the morphology of their flowers. The Fisherâ€™s Iris data set contains 50 samples of the 3 Iris species. They are Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris versicolor. The dataset contains 4 features - the widths and lengths of petals and sepals. Its reguraly used to test machine learning alogoritms.

I downloaded the Iris dataset as a csv format.
