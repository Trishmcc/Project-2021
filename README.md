# An investigation into the Fisher's Iris Data Set

## BY: Trish OGrady

### Introduction:

In 1936, Ronald Fisher, a statistician and biologist developed a linear function to differentiate Iris species based on the morphology of their flowers. The Fisherâ€™s Iris data set contains 50 samples of the 3 Iris species. They are Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris versicolor. The dataset contains 4 features - the widths and lengths of petals and sepals. Its reguraly used to test machine learning alogoritms.[1]

### Dataset

The Iris dataset is downloaded as a csv format.[2]

### Explanation of code

*Import Pandas Library*

* The Pandas python toolkit which is an open source that is used for data analysis. It makes working with CSV files simplier and more effective as it can read and write data from different formats, i.e CSV (Common Seperated Values)[3] The dataframe object is also useful for groupimg which will be demonstated in this project.
* print(df) clarifies that df is the object name that contains the csv file

*Data Screening*   SHOW CODE

* Confirm file has been read correctly and identify information about the data:

print(df) To confirm that the csv file has been read correctly. It also identifies all column names and the number of rows and columns

* Code

* Output



* Dataframe class:

print(type(df)) identifies the class as a dataframe which is a container for storing and manipulating two dimensional data [4]

* Sepal Lenght and Width:

df2=df[['sepal_length','sepal_width']] To identify and subset the dataframe into 2 specific columns, i.e sepal lenght and sepal width. The double brackets returns a dataframe object as opposed to a series object[4]

*Descriptive Statistics*

* describe() function

stats=df.describe()   The dataframe.describe() function summarises the columns of the dataframe. It allows the viewing of the mean, count, max, min, std and so forth[5] 


Pandas call the describe function using the dot operator and the double square brackets allow for multiple columns to be displayed.[6]

 stats=df[['sepal_length']].describe() This summarises an individual column

*Grouping*

* mean by all species

* The groupby function involves splitting the object, applying a function, and/or combining the results.[7] So it searches through multiple categories and groups by a particular value of each category.[8] In this case, the data is split into groups based on the mean of all attributes for each species in the dataframe.[9] 

mean_sl=df.groupby(['species']).mean()

* Count by all species

* The pandas toolkit automatically runs the .count() calculation for all remaining columns, i.e species[11]

* 4 attributes are identified and each species has 50 data points. 

count_species=df.groupby(['species']).count()

*Summary data to text file*

This gives a simple description of the data. The seperator ',' is applied to seperate the columns in the text file. The 'a' append mode is applied too.

stats.to_csv('summary_iris.txt', header=True, index=True, sep=',', mode='a')

mean_sl.round(2).to_csv('summary_iris.txt', header=True, index=True, sep=',', mode='a')

*Exploratory Data Analysis*

*Import matplotlib*

* Matplotlib is a useful plotting tool with a collection of functions used for visualisations[15]

CODE

import matplotlib.pyplot as plot_lib

OUTPUT


* Creating the histogram for each variable
  
* A histogram displays continuous data values on a graph by grouping data into bins of equal width. Each bin is plotted as a bar. The height of each bin corresponds to how many data points are in that bin.[16]

Four histograms are created to display the sepal lenght, sepal width, petal lenght and petal width.

The histogram is defined in the function by its x and y axis and histogrm name. The y label is not hard coded meaning the variable will get its value dynamically when the function is called.[17]

The legend is dislpayed in the upper right[18]

* Create a Scatter Plot

A scatter plot is a graph that displays plotted points which identify a relationship between two variables[24]

The x and y labels are dynamic as are the x and y arguements. 

12 scatter plots are created.

Each dot represents either sepal lenght, sepal width, petal lenght and petal width.

Variations in Scatter plots: sepal_length=1, sepal_width=2, petal_length=3, petal_width=4
1,2 1,3 1,4 2,3 2,4 3,4
2,1 3,1 4,1 3,2 4,2 4,3



They excluded the NaN values. However, the Iris data set has
